      <p className="main-content__text">
        I first learnt to code for the web when I was learning to sell virtual
        items on a virtual pet website, Neopets. HTML and CSS was a large part
        of my childhood. A decade later, I learnt html 1.1 strict and CSS during
        my college years. Then, I managed to get a job in the dental health care
        industry, managing marketing, information technology, and bookkeeping. I
        fell in love with creating automated workflows for me and my team.

        When I created my first Microsoft Batch script utility for my manager to
        manage Virtual Private Network connections and network drives, we were
        both extremely thrilled and amazed on how much time it saved.

        Then I spent countless hours learning new technologies such as
        autoHotkey to automate more workflows. I then extended this to creating
        scripts for backing up crucial data on a file server and desktops, and
        creating login scripts for managing group policies on an Active
        Directory Server.
